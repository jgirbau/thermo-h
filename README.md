Horizontal Thermometer Indicator

This is a new version of Thermometer Indicator, but this time we made it horizontal instead of vertical. Due to we discover save a lot more of space and easier to fit in your web design, because of the convenient size proportion of 2x1.

You only need to Copy-Paste the Canvas and Script objects of the html page to your web page, and be sure the termoh.js file is inlude it in your js folder.

Please, always keep width x height relation of 2x1 in the canvas object, and we recommend at least 200 x 100 px to see all details.

If you need to place the javascript file in a different location, you only need to do the proper modification in the src attribute of your script object.

I hope you enjoy this fancy web part. And you can try it in the [Demo Page](https://jgirbau.github.io/thermo-h/).
